    <h3>Early Life</h3>
      <p>
        Mika was born in July of 2012 on Independance Day. From early life, it was known that she would be a wild girl. Her birth family had small children and either couldn't
        or were unwilling to properly care for her so she was relegated to the chain outside. It was here that she spent her first year of life. Alone and neglected with nothing to keep her occupied
        but the dirt at her paws. To keep herself entertained, she started digging. No one would play with her so she started making friends with the mudholes all around her.
        Her favorite pasttime (yea, her only pasttime) was flinging dirt clods into the air and cathing them with her teeth. Thus, she developed a lifelong passion for
        destroying her owner's yard. A hobby she still enjoys to this day.

    <h3>Forever Day</h3>
      <p>
        Unbeknownst to Mika, life was about to change for the year old German Shepherd. A 30 year old divorcee named Brad had just lost his two dogs, a female-male
        bloodhound pair named Lulu and Copper, to his ex wife. Although devastated, Brad was determined to have another dog. After all, dogs truly are a man's best friend.
        After a long, gruelling day or two scouring Craig's List, Brad found a listing for a female GSD. The ad said she was well trained (lie) and good in a car (another bold lie).
        Brad was sold. He arranged to meet the current owners the next day. On arrival, she was a beautiful, happy looking dog with her toungue hanging and tail wagging.
        He noticed that her leash was closed in the car door. Thinking nothing of it, he handed the money over and she jumped in his truck. 30 seconds in the truck showed him why
        the leash was closed in the door. She was a crazy girl but she was his. Brad always had a soft spot for crazy girls anyway.

               10 years later, Mika is still with us. Ruling her house and destroying her yard. She sheds a mountain of fur a day and bosses her brother, a Chow mix named Christian, around
                like the true born diva that she is. Her hobbies today are playing with her friends the dirt clods and watching anything on the tv. She learned long ago that if she watches long enough,
                an animal will appear and she can bite at it. It's good to be Queen!
